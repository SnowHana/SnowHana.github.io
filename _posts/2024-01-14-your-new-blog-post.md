## This is my first blog post
### How it all started...
I was always dreaming of having my personal blog, not only for a career-wise reason, but to simply keep track of what I have been doing.
But all those tutorials on the internet, seemed overwhelming, time-consuming, and most importantly...costly!
(Because you need to pay for your domain, host...etc)

And then, I came up with this wonderful tutorial, basically letting me use github to publish my blog.

So this is how it all started!

### Rules
There would be three rules I would follow in terms of managing my space.

**1. Just keep writing!**

**2. Follow rule 1**

**3. Again, follow rule 3**

Yep, I will just keep writing.

Not all blog posts would be tech edgy but no matter what, I'll just keep writing.

```c
while(1)
  keep_writing();
```
